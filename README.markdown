Just a Bunch of Files
=====================

Directories match what I use in my home directory. If you have a conflicting
file in your own directory, take a look at what is in my copy, and decide if
you want to merge them, copy mine, or ignore mine.

All files are optional, but some depend on others (for example the .gitconfig
refers to the .gitignore file).
